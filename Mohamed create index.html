    <h1>My name is Luke Mohamed</h1>
    <p>Hello, My name is Luke Mohamed, I retired from the army recently. I was a medic for 6 years and am now trying to learn a new profession. My favorite hobby is to paint Warhammer 40k models and read the books. I know that has been a reoccurring theme in my submissions and for that I'm sorry. I recently adopted a new puppy as well; very cute!</p>
